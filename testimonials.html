<h1>Testimonials</h1>



<div class="testimonial_quote">
<p>I suffered for many years with digestive discomfort and constipation and read about colonic irrigation on Joanne&rsquo;s website and decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>I felt really apprehensive and nervous before my treatment, but Joanne made me feel at ease straight away and throughout the treatment.</p>
<p>After my hour session, all I can say is it changed my life. I felt full of energy and no longer had abdominal pain or constipation.</p>
<p>A treatment I would definitely recommend.</p>

<p>I have been in the health and fitness industry for over fifteen years so have always exercised and eaten well. </p>
<p>However, two years ago, I started to suffer stomach pain, bloating and tiredness which became progressively worse.</p>
<p>I decided to speak to Jo Vega about Colon Hydrotherapy. From my first phone call and consultation to my last maintenance treatment I have found her to be extremely hygienic and professional and very approachable and trustworthy.</p>
<p>My symptoms disappeared after my second treatment and because Jo was so knowledgeable she helped me understand that I had to make changes in my lifestyle which, in time, helped to increase my energy levels too.</p>
<p>I am more than happy to recommend Jo Vega&rsquo;s colon hydrotherapy to my clients and friends as these treatments combined with my personal fitness training will give them even better results.</p>

<div class="testimonial_quote">
<p>I have been struggling with weight gain and feeling a little bloated coupled with starting to notice changes with my body due to getting older (35 years), so I decided to really start looking after myself. An &lsquo;inner cleanse&rsquo; is just what I was looking for. </p>
<p>I am so pleased I had a colonic (colon hydrotherapy) with Joanne. The salon had a lovely calm atmosphere. Joanne clearly explained the treatment followed by its benefits. Even though it&rsquo;s a little invasive I felt totally at ease and my modesty was kept at all times. What I really liked about Joanne was her knowledge about the body and nutrition.</p>
<p>I have since had several treatments and will continue. I have made some simple changes to my life. My results have been great. More energy, I felt lighter and less bloating.</p>

<div class="testimonial_quote">
<p>I suffered from bloatedness for a long time with frequent stomach cramps. Colon hydrotherapy was recommended to me. After one session the bloating disappeared and I felt a lot lighter and my clothes were more comfortable. The session also included an abdominal massage and a discussion about food and managing intolerances to food. This was a very successful treatment for me and I would recommend it to anybody suffering from digestion problems.</p>

<p>Jo is an extremely friendly and knowledgeable practitioner &ndash; I felt totally at ease during my treatment.I turned to Jo in an effort to address a severe lack of energy due to work-related stress. At the end of my treatment I was completely charged &ndash; full of vitality, and approaching life with a sense of clarity that I had not experienced before.</p>
<p>I would recommend this treatment to anyone.</p>
