        <h1>MLD Testimonials</h1>



        <div class="testimonial_quote">
          <p>Having recently recovered from long term Chronic Fatigue Syndrome I decided to undergo a course of 6 Manual
            Lymphatic Drainage to rid myself of related toxins.
            After experiencing Jo's tactful and discreet manner from having a colonic I had no hesitation in choosing
            her as my MLD practitioner. With Jo's friendly down to earth approach I automatically felt at ease and able
            to relax and enjoy the treatment. As the treatments have progressed the results have been amazing, my energy
            has increased, I feel younger and an unexpected bonus was the clearing of a long-term sinus problem.
            I would definitely recommend MLD as an excellent way of rejuvenating body and mind and with Jo as your
            practitioner you can't go wrong.

          <p>After a gentle detox I decided to follow it up with a course of Manual Lymphatic Drainage.
            The course of 3 treatments recommended by Jo certainly helped to eliminate the excess toxins, however I was
            unprepared for the amazing results noticeable in my face which made me look younger!
            This non invasive treatment is conducted in a calm and comfortable atmosphere where every care is taken to
            ensure your privacy.
            Jo is a kind, understanding and caring practitioner who fully explained each step of the procedure and I
            would highly recommend both Jo and her treatments.

        <div class="testimonial_quote">
          <p>During my pregnancy I had regular MLD sessions with Jo. The swelling was so bad in my fingers that I could
            hardly bend them, and the treatments eased this lot.
            What I like about Jo is her compassion and skill as a therapist; I used to be in the health and beauty
            profession before starting a family so I know how important this is.
            Now Joseph is born I am really busy but still manage to have the occasional treatment as it is so relaxing
            and nice to have an hour to myself.

        <div class="testimonial_quote">
          <p>When Jo first told me about MLD I was fascinated as I have always suffered from water retention - don't get
            me wrong I don't mean in a severe way but always knew I held water, especially at certain times of the
            month, so I was keen to give it a go. During the first session Jo concentrated on my face and I have to say
            I was amazed, the results were noticeable after the first treatment and the eye bags I thought were
            hereditary and had resigned myself to the fact that I just take after my dad for them and have to live with
            them had really gone down. When I got home my husband even commented and noticed a difference in my face. I
            have since been back for more treatments and have had my body (especially legs) done too and the results are
            the same there. And what's even better is that it's so relaxing, it's not painful or uncomfortable in any
            way &ndash; in fact I went to sleep during all my sessions! This treatment comes highly recommended from me
            and I'll definitely be back for more! Oh and it's fabulous if you're pregnant too!</p>
